** A lisp for dotnet
This will eventually be a lisp intended for runtime scripting dotnet applications, and especially Monogame things.

** Why Malf?
This was started as an implementation for kanaka/mal in fsharp, and I plan to continue its development further than mals target, especially re: dotnet interop
It's short for Mal Fsharp, or Malfease. 
*Malf(ease) is short for Mal Fsharp Embedded Awful Script Engine*
