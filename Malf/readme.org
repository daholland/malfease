* Malf

** A lisp for dotnet
This is a mal lisp intended for runtime scripting dotnet applications, and especially Monogame things.

** Why Malf?
This was started as an implementation for kanaka/mal in fsharp, and I plan to continue its development further than mals target, especially re: dotnet interop
It's short for Mal Fsharp, or Malfease. 
*Malf(ease) is short for Mal Fsharp, and Embedded Another Scripting Engine

** Licenses!
*** Malf(ease)
**** Current release is MIT, and libraries retain their own licenses. I made some effort to collect the licenses of libraries used along the way.
*** Libraries
**** dotnet core 5 - mit
**** FPParsec http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/license.html - heavily sourced the json parser; indeed, thats 75% of the way there for mal
**** mal https://github.com/kanaka/mal - slightly modified runtests.py, and uses its guides and tests.
